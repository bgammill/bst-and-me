bst-and-me
==========
###### An over-ambitious attempt to implement the [binary search tree](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree) data structure in as many languages as I can.

### Progression
Ideally, I want to implement each BST in this order
 1. JavaScript
 2. PHP
 3. C#
 4. Java
 5. Scala
 6. Python
 7. Ruby
 8. C++
 9. Dart
 10. C
 11. D
 12. Go

*My proficiency in each language is nearly identical to the order in which they're listed.*
